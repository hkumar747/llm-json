Proposed work woul d include the following:(a)Excavation of approx imately 936-linear-feet of uplandsadjacent to the St. Johns River to realign McCoys Creek approximately 92-feet east of the existing McCoys Creek outfall. This alignment would connect the existing McCoys Creek to the southeast of the May Street Skyway crossing to the north and the St. Johns River to the south. The new alignment would vary in wid th, between 55-feet (single bul khead section) and 60-feet wide (double bulkhead section). The new alignm ent would be underlain by a 1-foot-thick reinforced concrete bed covered by a 1-foot-thick live bed of sand and muck and would encompass 1.66 acre of waters of the United States (open, tidal water). 2(b) Stabilization would be accomplished by the installation of vertical bulkheads along the entire channel corridor as follows: (i)Single bulkhead area: The norther n 452-linear-feet would be stabilized by 3-foot-thick bulkheads made of metal sheet pile with a concrete fa\u00e7ade (reference drawing labeled Bulkhead Cross Section) . The bulkheads would be approximately 18-feet tall above mean water level (25-feet above channel bottom grade). The inner face of wall exposed to water on the easte rn wall is approximately 348-linear-feet along the creek, while the western wall isapproximately 296-linear-feet along the creek. All work would occur in uplands prior to the new alignment being connected to the existing McCoys Creek and the St. Johns River. (ii)Double Bulkhead Area: The s outhern 484-linear-feet woul d be stabilized by a double bulkhead system to allow the cr eek to stage up during flood events (reference drawing labeled Tier Cross Sect ion). The inner primary walls would be 3-feet-thick bulkheads made of metal sheetpile with a concrete fa\u00e7ade. These bulkheads would be approximat ely 2.7-feet above mean wa ter (7.7-feet above creek bottom grade). The face of the inner eastern wall is app roximately 269 linear feet along the creek while the inner western wall is approximately 293 linear feet along the creek. (iii)Secondary bulkheads would be loca ted approximately 12-feet landward of the primary inner walls. The secondary bulkhead s would be 3-feet-t hick bulkheads made of metal sheet pile with a concrete fa\u00e7 ade. The height of the secondary bulkheads varies between 20-feet in height above meanwater level and 9-feet in height above mean water level, dependent on the adjacent natural upland topography. The face of the outer eastern wall is appr oximately 281-linear-feet and the outer western wall is approximately 305-linea r-feet (reference Tier Cross Section 2 drawing). Proposed bulkheads would be installed utilizing im pact hammer or vibratory methods in dry conditions prior to the opening of the creek to allow water inflow. The space between the walls would be concrete which w ould be paved and accessible to pedestrians when not inundated. (iv)The northern 452-linear-feet woul d be supported utilizing inner steel trusses (reference Support Truss Detail map, Suppor t Cross Section map). These trusses range between 54 and 60 feet in length span ning the new channel and are 6-feet in width. The trusses would be elevated approx imately 12-feet above mean water level to maintain navigability of the channel by small, non-motorized watercraft.(v)To install floating vegetative mats to facilitate vegetative recruitment, wildlife utilization, nutrient uptake, and improve aesthetics. The mats would be attached to the bulkheads to create a meandering central flow path. Mats varyin size, from 30-feet in length to 100-feet in length and are ei ther metal or rigid plastic frames. Mats would not encroach more into more than 25% of the channel at any given point. 3 Mats would be planted with native wetland sh rubs and grasses tolerant of the tidal fluctuation within this area. (vi)To install vegetative habitat thatwould be hanging from the trusses close to the proposed bulkheads for recruitment of vegetation and aquatic organisms. The hanging habitat would not ext end further waterward into the newly created channel more than 25% of the channel and they would not inhibit navigation by small, non-motorized vessels. 2.To dredge 0.06-cubic-yards of material from 2,845-square-feet of waters of the United States (open, tidal water tidal wetlan ds) to place 352.51-cubi c-yards of fill and rip rap into 2,845-square-foot area for shoreline stabilization where the realigned McCoys Creek flows into the existing McCoys Cree k. This would be a curved area and the new rip rap/fill would stabilize the shoreline as the water from the realigned creek converges with the existing creek and flows into the ex isting creek. The dredged material would be disposed of in uplands at the Trail RidgeLandfill would be dredged through mechanical methods. 3.Removal and replacement of the existing rip rap shoreli ne stabilization along the St. Johns River and includes the following: a.Removal of 645.33-cubic-yards of exis ting rip rap from 0.20-ac re of waters of the United States (open, tidal water below the mean high water line). The rip rap would be removed from approximately 470-linear-feet along the shore and a maximum of 50-feet offshore into the St. Johns River in the ar ea of the existing McCo ys Creek outfall area, the proposed McCoys Creek realignment, and north of the proposed McCoys Creek realignment. b.Placement of 645.33-c ubic-yards of rip rap into 0.20- acre of waters of the United States (open, tidal water) in front of t he existing McCoys Creek outfall and north and south of the new McCoys Creek outfall t hat would be 470-feet -long and would range from 15-feet wide to 46-feet- wide to 78-feet in width.4.At the Mouth of the New McCoys Creek Channel:a.Conduct new dredging to remove 1,739. 54-cubic-yards of mate rial from 0.22-acre of waters of the United States (open, tidalwater) to create a new outfall channel into the St. Johns River. The channel would be appr oximately 116-feet wide and would extend approximately 88 feet waterw ard of the mean high water line. The area would be dredged to -9.5 feet in depth. The dredge wo uld be conducted by mechanical methods. The dredged material would be disposed of in uplands at the Trail Ridge Landfill. b.Placement of 878-cubi c-yards of clean granite rip rap into 0.22-acre of waters of the United States (open, tidal water) to stab ilize the newly created outfall channel to the St. Johns River. The rip rap would be 116-feet -wide and extend 88-f eet from the mean high water line into the St. Johns River to armor the newly created channel against 4 erosion. The rip rap would be a uniform 2.5-feet thick, placed fr om -9.5-feet mean low water to -7-feet mean low water.5.Placement of 21,000-cubic-yards of fill material into 0.85-acres of waters of the United States (open, tidal water) to backfill the existing McCoys Creek channel for 890-feet. The entire 890-feet would be filled in or der to realign the creek to a new location east of the existing creek. The realigned cr eek would be reopened prior to the filling of the existing McCoys Creek. The proposed work would also include pedes trian bridge, which would be reviewed under the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard. The pedestrian bridge would be 72-feet-long by 19.6-feet-wi de, spanning the new Section 10 McCoys Creek alignment at the outfall into the St. Johns River. The bo ttom of the bridge woul d be set at elevation 17-feet above the water. The McCoys Creek construction would requiretemporary closure of the North Bank Riverwalk between the Acosta Bridge and the existing McCoys Creek (approximately 1,500-feet east of the Wins ton Riverside YMCA). The Love Locks Bridge over the railroad would remain open. The North B ank Riverwalk would be reopened once construction is complete with a new route that would consist of the new pedestrian bridge over the realigned McCoys Creek.The relocation of the McCoys Creek outfall w ould facilitate the development of a new mixed-use residential/commercial developmentwithin a previously developed upland parcel adjacent to the new outfall location.
