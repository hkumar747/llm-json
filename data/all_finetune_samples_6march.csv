Access Road -Approximately 990 cubic yards of local fill will also be required to shore up the western access road from the well pad back to the former logging road staging area.The measurement of the access road within wetlands measures 1,487- feet x 12- feet x 1.5 feet .The remaining upland portion of the road measures 1,189 x 12- feet x 1.5 feet (0.32 acres) . The permanent access road will permanently impact 0.41 acres of bottomland hardwood wetlands. Culverted Crossing -The temporary culverted crossing would remain as a permanent structure. The culvert [48- inch x 30- foot] will remain placed in an unnamed tributary creek located about 1,150- feet east of the well pad. The temporary crossing consists of a geotextile fabric placed along the access road and well pad area, followed by placement of timber mats measuring 12- feet wide by 6- inches thick .The temporary oak mat boards used will be removed and replaced with 1.0? -1.5 will be placed on the existing underlayment of geotextile fabric. The crossing will require placement of approximately 15 cu yards of limestone gravel on sides and on top of the culvert. Trees and saplings wil be cut close to the ground and temporarily sidecast along the access road and side of well pad. Trees and saplings will be picked up and removed at the conclusion of the project. Silt fencin g, booms, straw wattles, and other siltation manag ement controls will be placed on the north and south sides of the culvert and ditch crossing. BMP's fill placement will consist of silt fencing and hay bales along the sides of the well pad and site access road to minimize siltation. Seeding of the periphery of the well pad will also be evaluated at the conclusion of the re- entry program to assess the need for soil stabilization around the well pad.If natural revegetation begins to take place, then re- seeding will not be necessary.All production fluids and liquids will be maintained in secured/contained tanks and containers within the established project area.No additional areas outside of the well pad will be required for fill placement, equipment staging, etc. Mitigation -Mitigation for the permanent impacts proposed will consist of the possible purchase of mitigation credits from a Wetlands Mitigation Bank in the g eneral area and/or other considerations consisting of, but not limited to, possible stream bank restoration in the area, restoration/enhancement of an impacted well site in the immediate area of the Yelverton #1 well site, o r other possible permi ttee responsible mitigation to demonstrate that there has been a sufficient amount of functional lift to another area to compensate for impacts resulting from the proposed activities.","{'wetlands': [{'wetland_type': 'bottomland hardwood', 'impact_quantity': '1.16', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'permanent', 'impact_type': 'fill'}]}"

CULTURAL RESOURCES : The Corps has determined that the permit area has been extensively modified by previous work and there is little likelihood that an historic property may be affected . ENDANGERED SPECIES: The Corps made determinations on the following species: West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), Kemp’s ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempii), Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), Smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) Basis for determination(s): West Indian manatee: The project site is located in an Important Manatee ( Trichechus manatus ) area. The Corps has made the determination that the proposed project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect (MANLAA) , the West Indian manatee and its designated critical habitat. Since the proposal by the applicant is for in- water construction, potential impacts to the endangered manatee were evaluated using The Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, and the State of Florida Effect Determination Key for the Manatee in Florida (Manatee Key), dated April 2013.Use of the Manatee Key resulted in the following sequential determination: A>B>C>D>E >N>O>P>3 with further consultation necessary for MANLAA. The Corps will req uest Fish and Wildlife Service concurrence with this determination pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Smalltooth sawfish and sea turtles: The Corps evaluated the proposed work utilizing NMFS’s Jacksonville District’s Programmatic Biological Opinion (JAXBO) dated 20 November 2017. The JAXBO analyzes the effects from 10 categories of minor in- water activities occurring in Florida and the U.S. Caribbean on sea turtles (loggerhead, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, hawksbill, and green); smalltooth sawfish; Nassau grouper; scalloped hammerhead shark, Johnson's seagrass; sturgeon (Gulf, shortnose, and Atlantic); corals (elkhorn, staghorn, boulder star, mountainous star, lobed star, rough cactus, and pillar); whales (North Atlantic right whale, sei, blue, fin, and sperm); and designated critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass; smalltooth sawfish; sturgeon (Gulf 2 and Atlantic); sea turtles (green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead); North Atlantic right whale; and elkhorn and staghorn corals in accordance with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Based on past permitting practices of the Corps and review of consultations with similar in- water construction activities, Project Design Criteria (PDCs) were identified in the JAXBO that typically have been applied to permitted in- water construction activities. These PDCs ensure effects of in- water construction activities are minimal in nature and do not result in adverse effects to listed species or to essential features of designated CH. For this verification, the Corps conducted a project specific review to ensure that all of the PDCs were met. In accordance with the project -specific review process established in the JAXBO, a PDC checklist, certification that the activity meets the applicable PDCs, and supporting documentation for the proposed activity were emailed to nmfs.ser.statewideprogrammatic@noaa.gov and jaxbo@usace.army.mil on 08 September 2020 Activity 3: M aintenance Dredging. For Activity 2: Pile Supported Structure, on 08 September 2020 the Corps sent NMFS a request to supersede the standard JAXBO PDCs to allow the project to exceed the 50-slip minimum .Therefore, the Jacksonville District satisfied the project -specific review requirements stipulated in the JAXBO and satisfied its obligation under the ESA for the above- listed species and critical habitats within the NMFS purview.

The project consists of three segments that include Phase I, an interchange with the Suncoast Parkw ay, and Phase I I. Phase I would be located west of the Suncoast Parkway interchange and would consist of a 4­lane divided roadway that is approximately 4.2 miles in length. The proposed roadway would intersect the Suncoast Parkway approximately 3.2 miles south of SR -52 at an existing overpass.A full diamond interchange and approximately 1 mile of 4- lane divided roadway would be constructed within the limits of the interchange.Phase II would be located east of the Suncoast Parkway interchange and would consist of 4 -lane divided roadway that is 3.44 miles in length. An additional 2.78 acres of wetlands/waters are proposed to be temporarily filled/impacted to facilitate construction of the roadway, including bridges. Temporary fill material and/or temporary structures, such as drain pipes, coffer dams, etc. , would be removed upon completion of construction and the area would be returned to pre- construction contours and 2hydrologic conditions. Best management practices, such as underlying temporary fill with geotextile, would be incorporated to minimize impacts and ensure clean removal of temporary fill material. Previous iterations of this project proposed Phase II as a limited access roadway, allowing only one access point to a commercial parcel located on the east side of the interchange.

This public notice is being published primarily due to this change in status of Phase II. The precise number and location of potential intersections is not yet known and the applicants are not seeking authorization for any impacts to waters of the United States that may be associated with these potential intersections or associated developments .Pasco County has stated that developers would be responsible for obtaining authorizations for any impacts to waters of the United States beyond those currently proposed for construction of the Ridge Road Extension. Note: The proposed Ridge Road Extension was previously noticed by the Corps on November 28, 2011.

27,Notice_NO_5282,"The applicant seeks authorization for the following:1.Realignment of McCoys Creek. Proposed work woul d include the following:(a)Excavation of approx imately 936-linear-feet of uplandsadjacent to the St. Johns River to realign McCoys Creek approximately 92-feet east of the existing McCoys Creek outfall. This alignment would connect the existing McCoys Creek to the southeast of the May Street Skyway crossing to the north and the St. Johns River to the south. The new alignment would vary in wid th, between 55-feet (single bul khead section) and 60-feet wide (double bulkhead section). The new alignm ent would be underlain by a 1-foot-thick reinforced concrete bed covered by a 1-foot-thick live bed of sand and muck and would encompass 1.66 acre of waters of the United States (open, tidal water). 2(b) Stabilization would be accomplished by the installation of vertical bulkheads along the entire channel corridor as follows: (i)Single bulkhead area: The norther n 452-linear-feet would be stabilized by 3-foot-thick bulkheads made of metal sheet pile with a concrete façade (reference drawing labeled Bulkhead Cross Section) . The bulkheads would be approximately 18-feet tall above mean water level (25-feet above channel bottom grade). The inner face of wall exposed to water on the easte rn wall is approximately 348-linear-feet along the creek, while the western wall isapproximately 296-linear-feet along the creek. All work would occur in uplands prior to the new alignment being connected to the existing McCoys Creek and the St. Johns River. (ii)Double Bulkhead Area: The s outhern 484-linear-feet woul d be stabilized by a double bulkhead system to allow the cr eek to stage up during flood events (reference drawing labeled Tier Cross Sect ion). The inner primary walls would be 3-feet-thick bulkheads made of metal sheetpile with a concrete façade. These bulkheads would be approximat ely 2.7-feet above mean wa ter (7.7-feet above creek bottom grade). The face of the inner eastern wall is app roximately 269 linear feet along the creek while the inner western wall is approximately 293 linear feet along the creek. (iii)Secondary bulkheads would be loca ted approximately 12-feet landward of the primary inner walls. The secondary bulkhead s would be 3-feet-t hick bulkheads made of metal sheet pile with a concrete faç ade. The height of the secondary bulkheads varies between 20-feet in height above meanwater level and 9-feet in height above mean water level, dependent on the adjacent natural upland topography. The face of the outer eastern wall is appr oximately 281-linear-feet and the outer western wall is approximately 305-linea r-feet (reference Tier Cross Section 2 drawing). Proposed bulkheads would be installed utilizing im pact hammer or vibratory methods in dry conditions prior to the opening of the creek to allow water inflow. The space between the walls would be concrete which w ould be paved and accessible to pedestrians when not inundated. (iv)The northern 452-linear-feet woul d be supported utilizing inner steel trusses (reference Support Truss Detail map, Suppor t Cross Section map). These trusses range between 54 and 60 feet in length span ning the new channel and are 6-feet in width. The trusses would be elevated approx imately 12-feet above mean water level to maintain navigability of the channel by small, non-motorized watercraft.(v)To install floating vegetative mats to facilitate vegetative recruitment, wildlife utilization, nutrient uptake, and improve aesthetics. The mats would be attached to the bulkheads to create a meandering central flow path. Mats varyin size, from 30-feet in length to 100-feet in length and are ei ther metal or rigid plastic frames. Mats would not encroach more into more than 25% of the channel at any given point. 3 Mats would be planted with native wetland sh rubs and grasses tolerant of the tidal fluctuation within this area. (vi)To install vegetative habitat thatwould be hanging from the trusses close to the proposed bulkheads for recruitment of vegetation and aquatic organisms. The hanging habitat would not ext end further waterward into the newly created channel more than 25% of the channel and they would not inhibit navigation by small, non-motorized vessels. 2.To dredge 0.06-cubic-yards of material from 2,845-square-feet of waters of the United States (open, tidal water tidal wetlan ds) to place 352.51-cubi c-yards of fill and rip rap into 2,845-square-foot area for shoreline stabilization where the realigned McCoys Creek flows into the existing McCoys Cree k. This would be a curved area and the new rip rap/fill would stabilize the shoreline as the water from the realigned creek converges with the existing creek and flows into the ex isting creek. The dredged material would be disposed of in uplands at the Trail RidgeLandfill would be dredged through mechanical methods. 3.Removal and replacement of the existing rip rap shoreli ne stabilization along the St. Johns River and includes the following: a.Removal of 645.33-cubic-yards of exis ting rip rap from 0.20-ac re of waters of the United States (open, tidal water below the mean high water line). The rip rap would be removed from approximately 470-linear-feet along the shore and a maximum of 50-feet offshore into the St. Johns River in the ar ea of the existing McCo ys Creek outfall area, the proposed McCoys Creek realignment, and north of the proposed McCoys Creek realignment. b.Placement of 645.33-c ubic-yards of rip rap into 0.20- acre of waters of the United States (open, tidal water) in front of t he existing McCoys Creek outfall and north and south of the new McCoys Creek outfall t hat would be 470-feet -long and would range from 15-feet wide to 46-feet- wide to 78-feet in width.4.At the Mouth of the New McCoys Creek Channel:a.Conduct new dredging to remove 1,739. 54-cubic-yards of mate rial from 0.22-acre of waters of the United States (open, tidalwater) to create a new outfall channel into the St. Johns River. The channel would be appr oximately 116-feet wide and would extend approximately 88 feet waterw ard of the mean high water line. The area would be dredged to -9.5 feet in depth. The dredge wo uld be conducted by mechanical methods. The dredged material would be disposed of in uplands at the Trail Ridge Landfill. b.Placement of 878-cubi c-yards of clean granite rip rap into 0.22-acre of waters of the United States (open, tidal water) to stab ilize the newly created outfall channel to the St. Johns River. The rip rap would be 116-feet -wide and extend 88-f eet from the mean high water line into the St. Johns River to armor the newly created channel against 4 erosion. The rip rap would be a uniform 2.5-feet thick, placed fr om -9.5-feet mean low water to -7-feet mean low water.5.Placement of 21,000-cubic-yards of fill material into 0.85-acres of waters of the United States (open, tidal water) to backfill the existing McCoys Creek channel for 890-feet. The entire 890-feet would be filled in or der to realign the creek to a new location east of the existing creek. The realigned cr eek would be reopened prior to the filling of the existing McCoys Creek. The proposed work would also include pedes trian bridge, which would be reviewed under the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard. The pedestrian bridge would be 72-feet-long by 19.6-feet-wi de, spanning the new Section 10 McCoys Creek alignment at the outfall into the St. Johns River. The bo ttom of the bridge woul d be set at elevation 17-feet above the water. The McCoys Creek construction would requiretemporary closure of the North Bank Riverwalk between the Acosta Bridge and the existing McCoys Creek (approximately 1,500-feet east of the Wins ton Riverside YMCA). The Love Locks Bridge over the railroad would remain open. The North B ank Riverwalk would be reopened once construction is complete with a new route that would consist of the new pedestrian bridge over the realigned McCoys Creek.The relocation of the McCoys Creek outfall w ould facilitate the development of a new mixed-use residential/commercial developmentwithin a previously developed upland parcel adjacent to the new outfall location. The proposed work in uplands is not under the purview of the Corps; however, it would be review ed under the NEPA scope of analysis, National Historic Preservation Act, and the Endangered Species Act as the proposed work for the outfall stru cture would not occur but fo r the work in the uplands.","{'wetlands': [ {'wetland_type': 'waters of the United States', 'impact_quantity': '1.66', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'excavation'}, {'wetland_type': 'waters of the United States', 'impact_quantity': '2,845', 'impact_unit': 'square foot', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'dredging and fill'}, {'wetland_type': 'waters of the United States', 'impact_quantity': '0.20', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'rip rap placement'}, {'wetland_type': 'waters of the United States', 'impact_quantity': '0.22', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'dredging and rip rap'}, {'wetland_type': 'waters of the United States', 'impact_quantity': '0.85', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'fill'}]}"

38,Notice_NO_3653,"The applicant is requesting a 10-year permit to fill 70 acres of open water on the north central shore of Deer Island as a Beneficial Use (BU) for Dredged Material Disposal. The site would be referred to as Deer Island Habitat Restoration (DIHR) and is located approximately 2,200 linear feet to the west of Deer Island Marsh Restoration Two (DIMR2). The proposed project would include creation of approximately 1,975 linear feet of a coastal chenier (upland ridge) along the existing coastline and the southern boundary of the project site, and an outer berm, 4,520 feet in length, would be constructed along the proposed northern boundary of the project site and would run parallel to the north shoreline of Deer Island then curve south on the western most end to connect back to the Island. The outer berm and coastal chenier would be constructed from material on-site, dredged and placed mechanically. Sand dredged from the Black Warrior-Tombigbee Rivers would then be placed hydraulically to reinforce the outside of the berm. The outer berm would be constructed on the -4 feet MLLW contour and would be raised toSeptember 21, 2018 Page 2of5 an elevation of +6 feet MLLW. The interior coastal Chenier would be raised to an elevation of +4 feet MLLW. The eastern end of the containment berm would remain open to provide for tidal flushing as well as continuation of the marsh adjacent to Grand Bayou. Dredged material from various local dredging projects in Harrison and Jackson Counties would be placed within the 70-acre bermed site over the 10-year period. All dredged material would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for suitability of use within the BU site, through each individual permitting process. Within the disposal area, the dredged material would be pumped to a height of +3 to +5 MLLW initially, with final grade after dewatering and consolidation ranging from -0.5 to +1.5 MLLW. Two access channels located on the eastern and western side of the proposed site, would be dredged to -9 feet MLLW if needed for access. These channels would be placed in such a manner as to avoid existing reefs in the area. The channels would extend to a depth sufficient to allow barge access and not exceed 2,500 linear feet in length. Both access channels would need to be maintained for the 10-year life of the permit, or until capacity is reached. The material removed during the initial channel dredging would be side cast to the immediate west side of the channel in order to renourish the island. Any material removed during maintenance dredging over the 10-year life of the project, would be pumped into the BU site. The site would accept material incrementally for the life of the permit or until capacity is reached. Depending on the composition of the material placed into the site, the anticipated capacity would be between 470,000 and 575,000 cubic yards. The outside berm and interior marsh would be planted with appropriate marsh and dune species when construction and dewatering are complete. EXISTING CONDITIONS: Deer Island is a near shore island located just off the mainland of Biloxi, Harrison County, Mississippi. Deer Island is not considered a barrier island but rather an extension of the mainland geological structure. It is a Coastal Preserve comprised of approximately 650 acres. Most of the lands are owned, managed, and monitored by the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources. Habitat within the Preserve is comprised of Mississippi Sound sand bottoms, barrier island pond/lagoon complex, polyhaline marsh, mesohaline marsh, slash pine maritime forest, and relic dune scrub. Sediment surrounding the island is composed mostly of fine-grained sands, silty sands, and sands. A shellfish and SAV survey were conducted on August 29, 2017. No shellfish or SAV were found within the project boundary. PROJECT PURPOSE: As stated by the applicant, ""The beneficial use law in Mississippi (MS Code § 49-27-61) requires that all suitable dredged material, from projects greater than 2,500 cubic yards, be used beneficially. To comply with the law, the Beneficial Use of Dredged Material Program (BU) needs to have adequate capacity to accept dredged material from current and future dredging projects. Currently, Deer Island Marsh Restoration 2(DIMR2) is the only site in Harrison County that can accept dredged material and it is expected to be at capacity by December 31, 2018. Round Island and Greenwood Island, in Jackson County, are currently at capacity and expected to be at capacity by December 2018, respectively. Restored marshes protect shorelines fromwave energy while also performing environmental functions, such as increasing water quality, promoting settlement of suspended particulates, and providing habitat to various species of birds, fish, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. Restoration projects like that proposed, are critical to preserve and enhance vital habitats provided by Deer Island.""

42,Notice_NO_5425,"The applicant seeks authorization to rehabilitate and re- open the former Marina de Rincón facility. The proposed project would require the dredging of about 3,270 cubic yards of material from approximately 0.54 acres of waters of the United States within the marina basin to reach a water depth of 6.5 ft.Dredging the marina basin would result in impacts to approximately 0.06 acres of fringing mangroves existing along the northern margin of the basin. In addition, the project would require the dredging of about 2,354 cubic yards of sand from approximately 0.35 acres of waters of the U.S. to re -open the former marina entrance channel and reach a water depth of 6.5 ft. The total estimated volume of dredged material is 7,200 cubic yards, including over dredge. The marina basin would be dredged and de- watered prior to the dredging and opening of the entrance channel to prevent stagnant freshwater from the basin to flow out into the sea, and to minimize sedimentation/turbidity impacts to adjacent sensitive marine benthic resources. The proposed dredging activi ties would be conducted from uplands using long -reach excavators and other conventional earth moving equipment (the use of vessels/ barges is not anticipated as part of this project). The dredged material would be temporarily placed in a contained upland site located in the vicinity of the project area for dewatering . Once dry , the dredged material from the marina basin would be transported in dump trucks for final disposal at an authorized upland site, while the dredged sand from the marina entrance channel would be deposited above the mean high tide line in the adjoining beach to the southeast of the marina (as depicted in the enclosed drawings) . The proposed project activities would also include the improvement and extension of the existing breakwaters at both sides of the marina entrance channel . The north side breakwater would be extended approximately 82 ft in a southeast direction and would measure about 42 ft wide, while the south side breakwater would be extended 98 ft ina southeast direction and would have an approximate width of 74 ft. The extension of the breakwaters would require the discharge of about 1,177 cubic yards of fill material (core material and armor rock) into approximately 0.12 acres of waters of the U.S.The proposed project activities would further include the refurbishment of the existing boat ramp within the marina property. The ramp would be refurbished in its existing footprint under dry conditions, concurrent with the dredging of the marina basin.The top 4 inches of the ramp’s concrete surface would be removed, the reinforcing steel frame would be replaced, and a new concrete topping would be poured .The proposed 4 refurbishment of the boat ramp would require the discharge of fill material into approximately 0.01 acres of waters of the U.S . The proposed project would also entail the installation of a floating dock system in the marina basin. The floating dock system would consist of 12 floating finger piers measuring 25 ft long x 3 ft wide that would be connected to floating headwalks to be installed parallel to the eastern and western margins of the basin. Another headwalk would be installed along the northern margin of the basin. The floating dock system would be supported by 20 14- inches in diameter pilings and would occupy a total surface area of approximately 3,014 sq. ft (0.07 acres) . Ten 14-inchesin diameter mooring piles would be installed at the end of the boat slips (one between two boat slips). The proposed floating dock system would provide docking space for 20 small vessels.","{'wetlands': [{'wetland_type': 'waters of the United States', 'impact_quantity': '0.54', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'dredging'}, {'wetland_type': 'fringing mangroves', 'impact_quantity': '0.06', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'loss'}, {'wetland_type': 'waters of the U.S.', 'impact_quantity': '0.35', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'dredging'}, {'wetland_type': 'waters of the U.S.', 'impact_quantity': '0.12', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'fill'}, {'wetland_type': 'waters of the U.S.', 'impact_quantity': '0.01', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'fill'}]}"

58,Notice_NO_6173,"The applicant seeks authorization to install a Single Point Mooring (SPM) and an underwater pipeline systemfor the offshore transfer of bulk fuel from Very Large Bulk Carriersto the existingfacilities at the Limetree Bay Marine Terminal.The project would include the placement of two concrete coated 30 inchesin diameter parallel pipelinesfrom the end of the easter n jetty of the Limetree Bay Terminal to a Pipeline End Manifold ( PLEM ) to be located offshore at a water depth of approximately 150 feet below mean sea level.The systemwould then transition into three 24 inches in diameter hoses which would be suspendedmid water at a depth of 150feet to 250 feet to the Buoy Balance Position for the SPM.4Two sections of the parallel pipelines would be placed on the surface of the marine floor, while two other sections would have to be buried under the marine floor.Asstated above, the marine bottom offshore of the jetty consists of rock pavement or hardbottom composed of old reef material and limestone.To install the fir st offshore section of the pipelines , an approximately300 feet long, 62 feet wide and 20feet deeptrench would be excavated seaward f rom the end of the eastern jetty .This would require the temporary removal of a section of the revetment of the jetty.Th e revetment is composed of concrete tetrapods or dolos.After the dolos are removed, t he existing pavement or hardbottom would be broken and approximately 14,000 cubic yards ofmaterial, including broken hardbottom and sediments , would be dredged from the footprint of the trench.To minimize the impact of the oncoming seas and prevent erosion during excavation an open ended caisson would be driven enclosing the excavation area.In order to minimize turbidity impacts, turbidity barriers would be installed to the west (the predominant wave and current direction) to prevent suspended sediments from impacting the corals which have colonized the shoreline dolos and riprap.Once the excavation is complete, the pipelines would be placed, the trenchrefilled with the same material excavated from it , and the dolos returned to their original location to protect the terminus of the jetty.A clamshell or bucket type excavator would be used to create thetrench.The removal of the dolos and the initial 50 to 75 feet of trenching would be done from the shoreline.Beyond the reach of the shoreline equipment a spud barge would be used to complete the trenching, pipeline placement, and refilling of the trench.The dolos would be temporarily relocated to an uncolonized area of marine floor to the southeast of the project footprint while the pipelines are installed.The material excavated from the shoreline would be temporarily stored on the jetty and protected by reinforced silt fencing while stock piled.The material excavated with the barge would be temporarily side cast along the project corridor while the pipelines are installed.The second section of the pipelines would be surface lain on the marine floor to the south over the next 600 feet before turning to the southwest to cross the Limetree Bay Terminal Navigation Channel.The pipeline would continue on the sea floor surface for 288 feet to the outer edge of the navigation channel .The third section of the pipelinecorridorwould requir e excavating an approximately 1,625 feet long, 62 feet wide and 16 feetdeep trench across the navigation channelusing anextended arm backhoe or a clamshell or bucket type crane excavator mounted on a barge .The pipelines would be buried down the channel wall and then beneath the uncolonized channel bottom and then up the slope on the western side of the channel.The channel floor is soft unconsolidated material which is uncolonized in the area of the crossing. The excavated mat erial would be temporarily side cast during the pipe placement and once the pipeline is in place the material would be replaced over the top of the pipeline.A total of 40,000 cubic yards of sediments would be excavated and t hen backfilled into the trench once the pipes are installed.Concrete mats would be placed over the pipes and backfill at critical areas.The same equipment used to excavate the trench would be used to cover it up.The excavated material would be side cast rather 5than lifting the mat erial completely out of the water to avoid suspending sediments throughout the entire water column.By keeping the material near the seafloor, it would keep the turbidity plumes near the uncolonized seafloor and sparsely colonized lower area of the channel walls.Keeping the material in the water also avoids having the material dewater while waiting to re- fill the trench.The excavation within the channel would be made so the top of the pipelines would be at minimum depth of 70 feet below mean sea level, so they would be at least 10feet below the existing channel floor which is 60feet below mean sea level.The fourth section of the pipelines would begin o nce the pipelines emerge from the channel .This section of the pipelines w ould be surface lain to a depth of 150 feet where the PLEM would be placed.The PLEM would be held in place by four 18 inchesdiameter piles which would be 60 feet in length.A submarine vibra- hammer on a crane barge would be used to install these pilings .The system w ould then transition into three 24 inchesin diameter hoses which w ould be suspended mid water at a depth of 150feet to 250 feet to the Buoy Balance Position for the SPM.Floats and weights would be used to hold the hoses in position and eightanchors would be used to stabilize the SPM in a position at 665 feet of water depth , which would allow for adequate depth for the tankers to swing without getting in to water less than 88 feet.Three anchors may be placed on the floated hoses if nec essary.The hose anchors and the SPM anchors would be anchor piles 60 inches in diameter and 80 feetin length.A submarine vibra- hammer on a crane barge would be used to install these pilings.The SPM would be placed in an area of restricted navigation.The PLEM hoses and SPM would be illuminated to allow for clear visibility of these structures.The sinking of the pipeline in place would be controlled by a crane on a barge, removal of floats and flooding of the pipe.Pipe sink divers and/or robots would assist and would bolt the pipeline sections together.The final pipeline route would be marked prior to the start of construction. The construction footprint of trenched sections of the pipeline would be approximately 62feet wide.The applicant isproposing to relocate all coralcolonie s located within 50 feet of the centerline of trenched sections of thepipeline corridor.For surface lain sections of the pipeline the applicant estimates an impact area of approximately 11 feet wide and is proposi ng to relocate all coral colonies located within 20 feet from the centerline of the pipeline corridor.An estimated total of 2 ,215 coral colonies would be relocated from the project corri dor.Those c oral colonies would be relocated to the east of their current location, outside of the project construction or impact corridor .According to applicant estimates, the project impact corridor would occupy an area of approximately 4.33 acres of marine bottom, of which approximately 1 .65 acres would consist of p avement or hardbottom areassupporting the essential features of Acroporaspp.6","{'wetlands': [{'wetland_type': 'unknown', 'impact_quantity': '4.33', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'loss'}]}"
59,Notice_NO_3548,"The applicant is requesting a 10- year Department of the Army Permit to construct a beneficial us e site for the placement of dredged material in the open waters of the Mississippi Sound. The purpose of this project as stated by the applicant is to create approximately 175 acres of marsh habitatin an area referred to as Railroad Corner. The proposed project would be c onstructed within an180-acreproject site currently consisting of shallow, open water habitat with wate r depths which vary from -1 to -5.5 feet Mean lower low water (MLLW). The proposed si te is located within the Mississippi Sound east of the mouth of the West Pascagoula River with marsh systems located to the east and west, the CSX Railroad bridge located to the north running between Gautier and Pascagoula. During a survey completed inSeptember 2022, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) was located along the we stern portion of the project ar ea. SAV was present from theedge of the marsh to approximat ely 15 feet waterward. Total acreage equals approximately 1.44 acres. No shellfish were observed withi n the project area during the survey.The project components would include the construc tion of three berms to hold approximately966,000 cubic yards of dredged material to suppor t the creation of appr oximately 175 acres of coastal marsh. An earthen berm would be c onstructed on the western side of the project area to preserve existing SAV habitat,a v egetated berm would be constructed along the eastern portion of the proposed site, and a rock berm would be constructed along the southern extent of t he project area.Rock Berm: An approximately 1,365 linear foot rock berm with a crest elevation of +6.2 feet MLLW would be construct ed along the southern ex tent of the project area. A 60-foot gap would remain between the western marsh and the western end of the proposed rock berm to allow for continued flow to the ar ea containing SAV along t he western portion of the project site. Two 30-foot gaps would be pl aced within the rock be rm to allow for tidal exchange and fish passage. Approximately 926 s quare feet of brackish marsh would be covered at the eastern tie- in of the rock berm.Vegetated Berm : An approximately 1,325 linear f oot vegetated berm with a maximum width of 55 feet and a crest elevation of +4.0 feet MLLW would be placed to reinforce a thin section of existing marsh on the eas tern side of the project areaEarthen BermAn approximately 3,500 linear footearthen berm with a proposed crest elevation of +2 feet mean lower low water (M LLW) would be constructed to protect existing SAV habitat located along the western side of the project area. The earthen berm would tie into the western end of the rock berm and ex tend to the northern boundary, paralleling the shoreline and providing a minimum 25-foot open water buffer for the SAV. This would create a tidal creek which would provide ti dal flow and fish access to any naturally occurring tidal creeks within the created marsh located on the eastern side of the earthen berm. In addition to preserving the existing h abitat, the establishmentof the earthen berm could provide additional habitat for existing SAV along its western boundary.Marsh habitatelevations would vary between -0.5 feet to +3 feet MLLW =+0 .2 to +3.7 feet NAVD88) with a target elevation of +1.0-foot MLLW (+ 1.7 feet NAVD88). Marsh planting is not anticipated as a component ofthe project. Due to the proximity of existing healthy marsh in the area, natural recruitment is ant icipated to provide seeding of the newly created BU areas. Juncus roemerianus (black needlerush) and Spartina alterniflora(smooth cordgrass) are two common marsh species k nown to exist in adjacent marshes and would be likely volunteers for recruitment to t he newly constructed beneficial use cells.Access channels : Due to the shallow depths in the vi cinity of the proposed berms, various construction access channels are proposed. A c onstruction access channel is proposed on the south side of the rock berm with an appr oach channel from t he mouth of Railroad Corner. Depending on site conditions, the construction channel may be located on the north side of the proposed rock berm. Access channels within the site along the westernearthen berm and to the eastern vegetated be rm may also be required for construction access. Access channels would be dredged to a bottom elevation of -6.7 foot, NAVD88 (-6.0 feet, MLLW) with a bottom width of 50 fee t. Dredged material from the channels wouldbe placed within the benef icial use site, for construction of the earthen berm, or for construction of the vegetated berm.
