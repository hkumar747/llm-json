        "4-bit NormalFloat or NF is a new information-theoretically optimal data type built on top of Quantile Quantization techniques. 4-Bit NF works by estimating the 2k + 1 (k is the number of bits) quantiles in a 0 to 1 distribution, then normalizing its values into the [-1, 1] range. Once we have that, we can also normalize our neural network weights into the [-1, 1] range and then quantize into the quantiles we got from step 2.\n",
